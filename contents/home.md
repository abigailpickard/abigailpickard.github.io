Thanks for visiting my website and your interest in my research. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Aston University in the College of Life and Health Sciences. My overarching research interests are child psychology, eating behaviours and child development. The current project I am working on is the ESRC funded research Appetite in Preschoolers: Producing Evidence for Tailoring Interventions Effectively [(APPETItE)](https://www.appetite-research.com/).

#### Research Intersts

I am an Early Career Researcher in the fields of developmental psychology and applied health psychology. My PhD research investigated the cognitive mechanisms underpinning food rejection in 3 to 7-year-old children. I obtained my PhD from the University of Burgundy, France in October 2021. Part of my PhD program included a six-month visiting researcher fellowship at Stanford University. I then went on to a postdoctoral research position at Aston University, UK. My current research investigates eating behaviours of young children that are associated with adiposity risk and the factors such as ethnicity, socio-economic background and parental feeding practices that are associated with such eating behaviours. My enthusiasm for research not only lies in the advancement of health psychology but also in communicating and translating our research findings to a wider audience.
