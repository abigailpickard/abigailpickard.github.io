Thanks for visiting my website and for your interest in my research. I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Edinburgh in the School of Health in Social Sciences. My overarching research interests are child psychology, eating behaviours and child development. I am currently working on my independent research investigating the development of eating trajectories in young children, please get in touch if you are keen to collaborate.

#### Research Interests

I am an Early Career Researcher in the field of developmental psychology and applied health psychology. My PhD research investigated the cognitive mechanisms underpinning food rejection in 3 to 7-year-old children. I obtained my PhD from the University of Burgundy, France in October 2021. Part of my PhD program included a six-month visiting researcher fellowship at Stanford University. I then went on to a postdoctoral research position at Aston University, UK. In that research position, I investigated the eating behaviours of young children that are associated with adiposity risk and the factors such as ethnicity, socio-economic background and parental feeding practices that are associated with such eating behaviours. My current line of research looks at the development of persistent fussy eating in childhood and the links with cognitive development. My enthusiasm for research not only lies in the advancement of health psychology but also in communicating and translating our research findings to a wider audience.
